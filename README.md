# Psychology of asking "Why?"

## Purpose
This simple tool:<br>
- Places you in a weird philosophical situation.
- Questions your beliefs.
- Makes you more confident in your beliefs (after some self-reflection).
- Teaches you to recognize that you know absolutely nothing.

## Premises

1. Any statement that a human says can be responded to with the simple question: "Why?".<br>
2. Doing this repeatedly will make them, in the end, either:<br> **①** lose their minds<br> **②** make them say "*I don't know.*" <br>
3. At that point you can disregard the validity of their original statement and they will look like a fool.

4. The longer someone can continue without doing these 2 things, the more confident and stable they are in their opinions & psychology.

- **Everything we say (knowledge and beliefs in epistemology), are founded on other things say. Ultimately what you say is just beliefs.**

- **The brightest, most confident person, would be able to respond to an infinite amount of why's.**

## Examples of trains of thoughts

### On Gravity
"Gravity exists → Because we have observed it → Because we are observant creatures by nature → Because we rely on a pair of eyes to make decisions → Because eyes are the best thing we have to be aware of our surroundings → That's just how the monad wanted it to be → I don't know"
